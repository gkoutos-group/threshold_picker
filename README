# Threshold Picker

This is a prototype to evalute the different threshold points for an AUC curve. It is also available at https://vroth.shinyapps.io/thresholdloss/.

## How to use

The costs are the different penalties for each prediction group. Insert some hypothetical values to get the loss curve started.


A file can be uploaded. This file must be a .csv file with comma separated values. The files requires a column with the `true label` of each datapoint (0 or 1) and a `prediction score` column with values between 0 and 1.
